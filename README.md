CanOpen
======
This plugin is useful for checking if native apps are installed on a user's iOS device. By passing an app scheme (e.g., 'fb://', 'gplus://', 'instagram://', etc...), CanOpen returns true if it detects the user has the corresponding native app installed.  By returning false, CanOpen allows the developer the ability to implement a fallback URLâ€“for instance, the app's location in the App Store, or a mobile web version of the corresponding app.
